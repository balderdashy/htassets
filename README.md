AdaptiveAutoIndex
===================

A makeover for your Apache directory listing.
---------------------------------------------

Uses jQuery Mobile to enhance the presentation of Apache's autoindex on mobile devices, including all modern browsers,

handheld devices:
*	IPhone
*	Android
*	Blackberry
*	WebOS/Palm
*	Windows Phone
*	IPod Touch

and tablets:
*	IPad
*	Android Tablets


Installation
----------------

Put .htaccess and .htassets in your web root.

You can put AdaptiveAutoIndex in a subdirectory, but know that jQuery Mobile will get confused if you traverse up the tree and then go back down into the root directory.
